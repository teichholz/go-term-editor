# go-term-editor

A simple editor I developed on in my free time. As of now this project is paused, since it took too much of my time and was not well scoped.

The project is inspired by:
- https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor: The implementation of a rope as a b-tree as well as many useful generic operations on it
- https://github.com/google/btree: A b-tree reference implementation in go

This project was my first experience with Go as language and I'am quite fond of it now. Though it lacks expressiveness in certain areas, the primitives it gives you are simple to understand with no magic behind them.

To implement the terminal editor, I used https://github.com/gdamore/tcell.
